            <p>
                The first time that I heard about the term async programming was with a very intuitive example, a chef
                doing a spaghetti dish.
                It was an abstraction that described in simples terms the differents between ascyncronous programming,
                parallel programming and syncronous programming.

                            <li class="list-group-item">1 - The chef start to chop all the vegetables.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">2 - Then the chef put oil in the pan and wait for it to heat up.

                            <li class="list-group-item">3 - Then he put the vegetables in the pan and cook them with
                                tomato sauce.</li>

            <h3>Lets look this examples from a computational look.</h3>
            <p>

                The first example, sync programming, is the regular way to compute a function in programming. The code
                is
                executed
                statement by statement, and it will not start any other task (statement) until the current is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second example, parallel programming, This one use threads(helpers), a thread of execution is opened
                for
                each task, once the result is computed the main thread of execution collect it and do something with it.
                This
                example is way much better but is also way much expensive because each thread opened, it is consuming
                computing power, so if you start to open to many threads you will start to slow down the performance.
                Notice
                that are task that depends from others to start. So, in many cases it doesn't make sense open a thread
                for
                each task
                since if there are dependencies the thread will need to wait until this dependencies being resolve to
                start.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third example, however, it feels that fits perfect for this abstraction. No need for extra workers,
                and
                the main thread (chef) is never waiting. This example seems to be very good and you can think that has
                left
                everything clear now. But in real, is just a scratch to the surface of what async programming is and it
                have
                left many questions to answer:
            </p>
            <p><strong>
                    How this can be achieved through async programming? </br>
                    How a single thread (the main thread) can split its processing over differents task without blocking
                    it
                    self waiting for a result?</br>
                    How the main thread know what task was completed and in what order the task's results are collected?
                    </br>
                    And when you should or should not use async programming?
                </strong></p>
            <p>
                To solve these interrogants and understand in deep how this is working lets first analyse the definition
                of
                asyncronous programming.
            </p>

                <h3>Definition of Asynchrony</h3>
                <a class="ml-2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">[wikipedia]</a>
            </div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">Asynchrony</a>, in computer
                programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow
                and ways to deal with such events. These may be "outside" events such as the arrival of signals, or
                actions
                instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program
                blocking to
                wait for results.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are one thing in this definition that you should pay attention. When the definition says that
                async
                programming <i>refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow,</i> many people
                can
                missunderstand this, thinking, this means that the async functions runs in a separatly thread and when
                they
                has finished its work, some callback function is executed. But what really happends is that the async
                function is acctually executed by the main thread of execution, but this function is intended to call
                some
                prossesing outside the main flow of execution and because of that it could run concurrently. Then when
                the
                result of the function is retrived an event is triggered and the call back function is executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, this is how the main thread can make this processings without blocking it self. And the reason is the task
                that
                are being called are outside the execution stack of the program. And just calling it, this one can run
                concurrently
                and an event is added which will be triggered when the task is completed.
            </p>
            <h3 id="premises">When to use async programming?</h3>
            <p>
                Async programming is in general a very good solution when: </br>
                1 - you don't want to block the main thread waiting for a task to be
                done</br>
                2 - and you can run this task outside the execution stack of your program. </br>
                These two premises are necessary for it to make sense to use async programming.
                For example the most common cases when is a benefit use async programming are:</p>
            <p>
                When you make I/O operations to databases, network or callings to a web server, (which the execution
                stack
                of your code never pass for the source code of the server), this processes occur independently and hence
                concurrently with the execution of your code.
            </p>

            When you want to some processing have place in a certain amount of time. What you do is create an event that
            will run a function when the time is over. Note, what is in real running asyncronous here is the chronometer
            that when time has been acomlpished will trigger the event and run the function, not the function it self.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Let's see now how this is achieved and the common structure of async programming</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="./img/pseudoCode.png" width="100%">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>
                        This example is a simulation of a call to an API. The async function do the call, and add an
                        event
                        to the event queue that will fire when the result is done, and then the function HandlingResult
                        will
                        be executed making use of the result obtained.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                This is the most common and easy aplication of async programming but let's see a better example that
                allow
                show how it works.</br>
                It is used Javascript's sintax to be easy for you copy the code and test the examples.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example1.png" width="70%" />
            </div>
            <div class="m-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Copy</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now wich you think that will be the order of printing in the console?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, it will be:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Async Function Complete</li>
                <li>Task Done After 300 ms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And the reason is that the async function in the moment of the call is executed and it return the value,
                which
                will be handled in the <i class="notranslate"> then </i> function by the console.log function. The
                timeout
                function will run asyncronous
                and when time is over will print the messsage.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what happens now?
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example2.png" width="70%" />
            </div>
            <div class="m-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Copy</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Well, the result will be:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Starting</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
                <li>Async Function Complete</li>
                <li>Task Done After 300 ms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The reason of why the message <i class="notranslate">Async Function Complete </i> is shown after <i
                    class="notranslate">Ending </i>
                is because the event pushed by the async function will only be triggered when the main thread have done
                all
                its work. So, this is an important
                feature, no matter what, an asyncronous event will never interrupt the main frame of execution. It will
                only
                take place after the main thread has done all its work.
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait a minute, if the async function is executed in the main frame of execution then will any
                operation
                done
                before the return (<i>lines 5-7</i>) performed before the next line after the call to async function
                (<i>line 12</i>)?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer is yes. And here is the example.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example3.png" width="70%" />

            <div class="m-2">

                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Result:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Starting</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
                <li>Processing some op in the async function</li>
                <li>Async Function Complete</li>
                <li>Task Done After 300 ms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The problem is that the <i class="notranslate">return </i> on an async function what it does, is
                subscribe
                the returned object to an event to be
                captured by the handling function (<i class="notranslate">console.log</i>) when the event is triggered .
            </p>
            <p>
                Then as you can see this ResolveIn function, not make sense to be async because the stack execution will
                be
                the same even if the function is not async. And this is a good example to allow you recognize when a
                function not need to
                be async.
            </p>
            <p>
                But let's make this function acctually depend of timeout to make sense to be async. To do that is needed
                the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await" class="notranslate"><i> await </i></a> keyword,
                which It
                is not within the objectives of this article to explain it, but basically what it does is put the
                instruction pointer
                to the next instruction out of the async function (<i>line 14</i>), and when the call to the external
                task
                is
                done,
                then it continue with the work in the async function.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example4.png" width="60%" />
            </div>
            <div class="m-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Copy</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Result:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Starting</li>
                <li>Op before timeout</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
                <li>Op After timeout</li>
                <li>Async Function complete After 300 ms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now the ResolveIn function has more sense since it will only push its event in the queue once the
                timeout
                function is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try now to add a <i>console.log </i> instruction onto the function's body of the first param of
                <i>setTimeout </i> (<i>line 2</i>) to see how this time it is
                shown before <i class="notranslate"> Async Function Complete After 300 ms</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that is clear that the async function is executed in the moment that is being called and the task
                executed concurrently in an independent task outside the flow of your program, the answer to the
                question
                posed about <i>Which handling function will be executed first if there are several calls to
                    async functions?</i> is easy. The first one that finish its work, since it will be the first one to
                push the event in the event queue. The following example prove it.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example5.png" width="55%" />
            </div>
            <div class="m-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Copy</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Result:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Starting</li>
                <li>Some Op in First Call</li>
                <li>Some Op in Second Call</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
                <li>Second Call has Finished</li>
                <li> First Call has Finished</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> When you should not use async programming? </h3>
            <p>
                Now, you probably already know this, but I want alert you about a common error. First all you should't
                use
                async programming
                in many cases, especially those that don't follow the premises shown before (I encourage you to research
                about it). But I
                want to alert you about a the missunderstanding of use async programming to run functions of your code that take long
                time
                to complete, with the objective of not block the main thread. First of all this example violates the
                premise
                number <a href="#premises">2</a>, because this function cannot run independently of the flow of your
                program, and hence it will
                anyway block your code while this function finishes to executing. The example below show the problem.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="./img/example6.png" width="50%" />
            </div>
            <div class="m-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Copy</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"> See Output</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Result:
            </p>
            <ul class="result notranslate">
                <li>Starting</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
                <li>Long Time Function has finished</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's seems that it does exactly what is wanted, but it doesn't. If you uncomment the line 3 you will see
                how
                all
                the processing is done before the line 10, and if you put a really long input to the
                function (test with 999999999) you will see how your main thread of execution is being block by this
                function. So, no, async programming is NOT intended to execute long time functions inside your code.
            </p>

            <h3> Conclusions </h3>
            <p>

                Well I hope that this series of questions and answer that comes to my mind while I was studying this,
                help you
                understand more about async programming.
                I recommend you make all this tests in your prefered language and search for the original documentation
                of how
                handle Async Programming. And also, test with differents input until you convence your self how it
                works.
